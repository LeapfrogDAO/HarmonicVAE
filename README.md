# HarmonicVAE Feedback System

🎵 **Think you can out-emote an AI?** Step right up to the HarmonicVAE Feedback System—where *you* get to tell our musical robot overlord if its beats make you boogie, bawl, or just yawn. This isn’t just feedback; it’s a vibe check for AI-generated tunes, complete with pulsing visuals that groove harder than your uncle at a wedding reception. 🎶

HarmonicVAE is an AI composer with big dreams (and maybe a few sour notes), and it needs *your* human soul to help it evolve. Rate its jams, spin the emotion wheel, and drop some truth bombs—it’s like music therapy, but for a machine. Let’s make AI music that doesn’t just play in elevators!

## Project Overview

The HarmonicVAE Feedback System is your backstage pass to shaping the future of AI music. It’s a slick setup that captures how HarmonicVAE’s tunes hit your heartstrings, with tools like:

- An **Emotion Wheel** that spins faster than a DJ at 2 a.m.
- A **Star Rating System** to crown the AI a rockstar—or send it back to rehearsal.
- **Rotating Comment Prompts** that ask the deep stuff, like “Did this bassline slap harder than Monday mornings?”
- **Audio-Reactive Visuals** that dance to the beat, because feedback should have *rhythm*.

Your input doesn’t just vanish into the void—it teaches HarmonicVAE to drop bangers instead of duds. Think of it as crowd-sourcing the next big hit, one emotion at a time.

## Features

- **Emotion Wheel**: Spin it like a game show wheel and land on how you feel—dancing with joy or brooding in a corner?
- **Star Rating System**: From “One-star snooze” to “Five-star encore!”—give the AI the applause (or boos) it deserves.
- **Rotating Comment Prompts**: Face questions like “Would this track get you through a breakup?” or “Does it vibe like a coffee shop playlist?”
- **Audio Reactivity**: Watch the visuals pulse like they’re auditioning for a light show—synced to the music’s soul.
- **Feedback Collection**: Your thoughts get scooped up and analyzed to make HarmonicVAE less “beep-boop” and more “boom-boom.”
- **Insights Dashboard**: Peek at how others felt—did everyone cry, or are you just extra sappy? (Coming soon!)

1. **Clone the Repo**: Snag the code like it’s the last guitar pick at the merch table.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/harmonic-vae-feedback.git
   cd harmonic-vae-feedback
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Feed the system its musical nutrients.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**: Hit play and let the good times roll.
   ```bash

## Usage

Time to take the mic and give HarmonicVAE some notes (pun intended):

1. **Generate a Track**: Hit "Generate New Track" and let the AI strum something fresh. It’s trying so hard to impress you!
2. **Listen Up**: Let the soundwaves hit you—sway, sob, or stare in confusion, it’s all fair game.
3. **Spin the Wheel**: Tell the AI if its tune made you feel like a pop star or a grumpy cat.
4. **Drop Some Stars**: Rate it 1 to 5—be brutal, be kind, just don’t be silent.
5. **Spill the Tea**: Answer a quirky prompt like “Did this melody make you text your ex?” (Optional, but encouraged.)
6. **Submit Your Set**: Click "Submit Feedback" and watch your wisdom shape the AI’s next gig.
7. **Encore or Insights**: Generate another track for Round 2, or check the **Insights Dashboard** to see if everyone else vibed the same way.

## Development

Want to remix this system? Keep the tunes flowing while you tweak:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This fires up `nodemon`, so the server restarts faster than a drummer after a coffee break. Code away!

## Insights Dashboard

Curious if your tears were a solo act? The **Insights Dashboard** (coming soon) spills the stats on how everyone felt—think of it as the encore where the crowd’s emotions take center stage.

## License

Licensed under Apache 2 because good music (and code) should be shared like mixtapes at a middle school.

## Acknowledgements

Shoutout to the coders, the AI whisperers, and the caffeine gods who kept this gig alive. Big love to the open-source posse for the tools, and to *you* for helping HarmonicVAE trade its robot clanks for human feels. Together, we’re tuning the future—one beat, one laugh, one “Wow, that slaps!” at a time.

we invite you to laugh, play, and connect with AI music like it’s your new bandmate. Ready to jam? Let’s make some noise! 🎸
