# HarmonicVAE Feedback System

🎵 **AI wif emote, y’all!** Step right up to the HarmonicVAE Feedback System—where *you* get to vibe-check our musical robot overlord and tell it if its beats make you boogie, bawl, or just yawn. This ain’t just feedback; it’s a full-on swagger session for AI-generated tunes, with visuals pulsing harder than your stepfather’s dance moves at a family reunion. 🎶

HarmonicVAE is an AI composer with big dreams (and maybe a few off-key clunkers), and it’s begging for *your* human soul to help it level up. Rate its jams, spin the emotion wheel, drop some truth bombs—it’s like music therapy for a machine with a beat. Let’s tune this AI so it skips the elevator Muzak and drops straight fire!

## Project Overview

This is your backstage pass to shaping AI music’s future. The HarmonicVAE Feedback System is a slick setup that catches how this AI’s tunes hit your heartstrings, loaded with tools like:

- An **Emotion Wheel** spinning wilder than a DJ at 2 a.m.
- A **Star Rating System** to crown the AI a rockstar—or send it back to the garage.
- **Rotating Comment Prompts** dropping deep cuts like “Did this bassline slap harder than Monday mornings?”
- **Audio-Reactive Visuals** grooving to the beat, ‘cause feedback’s gotta have *rhythm*.

Your input doesn’t just fade out—it’s the remix that teaches HarmonicVAE to swap “beep-boop” for “boom-boom.” Crowd-source the next banger, one vibe at a time!

## Features

- **Emotion Wheel**: Spin it like a game show and land on your vibe—dancing with joy or brooding like a goth at prom?
- **Star Rating System**: From “One-star snooze” to “Five-star encore!”—give the AI its applause or a swift kick.
- **Rotating Comment Prompts**: Hit with questions like “Would this track get you through a breakup?” or “Is this a coffee shop playlist contender?”
- **Audio Reactivity**: Visuals pulsing like they’re auditioning for a rave—locked to the music’s soul.
- **Feedback Collection**: Your hot takes get scooped up to tweak HarmonicVAE into something less robotic, more righteous.
- **Insights Dashboard**: Sneak a peek at the crowd’s feels—did everyone cry, or are you just extra sappy? (Dropping soon!)
