# Demo Audio Files for HarmonicVAE Feedback System

This directory contains sample audio files generated by the HarmonicVAE model.
These files are used for demonstration purposes in the feedback system.

## Files:
- `sample1.mp3`: A short demo of a calm, melodic piece
- `sample2.mp3`: A rhythmic, energetic composition
- `sample3.mp3`: An experimental, ambient soundscape
- `sample4.mp3`: A melancholic, emotional piece
- `sample5.mp3`: A bright, joyful composition

## Note:
Actual audio files need to be generated by the HarmonicVAE model or added manually.
The placeholder references in this README represent the expected files.
